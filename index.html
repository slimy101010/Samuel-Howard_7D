 <p><h1><strong><i>This</i>i</strong> is samuel's website on bloxfruits.</h1><br>  
    ok so now that we have started lets get straight into it firstly when you join the game <strong><em>you</em> will</strong> want to accept a quest for the bandits.<br>
    you can get this from the bandit quest giver that looks like this<br> </p>

     
    <img src="images.jfif" alt="A fluffy cat">
<P>Once you reach level 15 you will get a notification to go to the jungle quest give<br>
you need to follow the commpass to the jungle island please remember where it is<br>
This is because once you have 50000$ you will need to buy a fruit from the fruit gacha here.<br>
Keep doing the monkey quest from the jungle quest giver until you unlock the gorrilla king quest<br>
once you unlock the gorrilla king quest you will accept it and go to the other halve of the island to slay the<br>
gorrilla king.<br>
<br>
    Once you have done that swap servers so the gorilla king spawns again the way to do this is by pressing the button in the top wright of the screen then selecting a server.<br>
    once you have done this the game becomes quite repetative so you should follow what it says.<br>

    <h2>Part 2 End game blox fruits builds.</h2><br>
    now that you have reached max level by grinding in game quests you will be in sea 3<br>
    you will want to be able to pvp to train you skills because you do not need to level up any more<br>
    A lot pf these builds will need race v4 or special items from hidden quests so find videos online for them<br>
     <h3>Build one the portall spammer</h3><br>
