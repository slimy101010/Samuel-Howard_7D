 <p><h1><strong><i>This</i></strong> is samuel's website on bloxfruits.</h1><br>  
    ok so now that we have started lets get straight into it firstly when you join the game <strong><em>you</em> will</strong> want to accept a quest for the bandits.<br>
    you can get this from the bandit quest giver that looks like this<br> </p>

     
    <img src="images.jfif" alt="A fluffy cat">
<P>Once you reach level 15 you will get a notification to go to the jungle quest give<br>
you need to follow the commpass to the jungle island please remember where it is<br>
This is because once you have 50000$ you will need to buy a fruit from the fruit gacha here.<br>
Keep doing the monkey quest from the jungle quest giver until you unlock the gorrilla king quest<br>
once you unlock the gorrilla king quest you will accept it and go to the other halve of the island to slay the<br>
gorrilla king.<br>
<br>
    Once you have done that swap servers so the gorilla king spawns again the way to do this is by pressing the button in the top wright of the screen then selecting a server.<br>
    once you have done this the game becomes quite repetative so you should follow what it says.<br>

    <h2>Part 2 End game blox fruits builds.</h2><br>
    now that you have reached max level by grinding in game quests you will be in sea 3<br>
    you will want to be able to pvp to train you skills because you do not need to level up any more<br>
    A lot these builds will need race v4 or special items from hidden quests so find videos online for them<br>
     <h3>Build one the portall spammer</h3><br>
    in this build you will need<br>
    1. Portal fruit<br>
    2.Skull guitar here is a guide on how to get it <a href="https://blox-fruits.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_Guitar">Link to skull guitar</a>
<br>
    3.your prefered sword mine is spikey trident<br>
    this it because you can grapple onto your enemy's for a good combo starter<br>
    4.Dragon talon awakened by Uzoth<br>
    Dragon tallon is a thery good fighting style and will let you combo players this is a video to show you how to get it<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQngux4Dqk0">video</a>
 <br>
    this and the skull guitar will be your main sorce of DPS<i>(damage per second)</i><br>
    now onto the combo you should use the V move on portall to trap them in your dimension<br>
    then use X on spikeytrident to pull them towards you<br>
    next use x on dragon talon to grab and deal a load damage to them<br>
    if you have angel V4 activate it and watch them slowly be killed once that is done you<br>
    need to use dimentional rift again on poratal and instantly use Z on skull guitar to trap them in a<br>
    AOE atack after this you will need to evade there attacks using portals mobility<br>
    after this repeat until they are KILLED.
